### Monster Chomp (WIP)

This repository includes my prototype I created using the [crisp-game-lib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib) by [abagames](https://github.com/abagames).

I created this prototype as part of CMPM 170 - Rapid Prototyping's prototype assignment 2. It is a simple one-button input prototype where players need to correctly chomp on blue pieces and avoid chomping on red pieces.

#### Things I Intend to Add

- Adding teeth to the chomper.
- Replacing the red and blue blocks with food pixel art.
- Increase the speed of the block spawning as the player keeps playing.
- Randomize the block spawning so it spawns at random intervals than a constant interval.
- Update high score with the highest score the player managed to achieve before dying.
